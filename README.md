Rogue Ritual

Rogue Ritual is a free-roaming auto-shooter leveling game where the player controls a character who begins with simple ranged combat and gradually uncovers their true ritual-bound power.

This repository currently contains early design work and project structure. Development is focused on defining a tight, replayable core loop before full implementation.

---

Core Concept

- Free movement in a top-down arena
- Automatic targeting and spellcasting
- Enemies drop energy orbs on defeat
- Energy orbs are used to level up and upgrade skills
- Progressive difficulty over time

---

Planned Features

- Multiple upgradable spell paths (fire, lightning, defense)
- Scaling enemy waves and minibosses
- Lightweight meta-progression between runs
- Web-first deployment

---

Project Status

🟡 Early design / pre-implementation

Current focus:

- Finalizing MVP scope
- Locking the core gameplay loop
- Choosing the implementation approach (engine + tooling)

---

Tech Direction

To be determined. This project may use:

- A lightweight 2D engine (Godot, GameMaker, or Construct)
- Or a code-first approach once the MVP is locked
