Roaming decisions

ArchSorcer

ArchSorcer is a free-roaming auto-shooter leveling game where the player controls a sorcerer who automatically attacks nearby enemies while collecting energy orbs to unlock and upgrade magical abilities.

This repository currently contains the early concept and project structure. Development is focused on defining a tight core loop before full implementation.

---

Core Concept

- Free movement in a top-down arena
- Automatic targeting and shooting
- Enemies drop energy orbs
- Energy orbs are used to level up and upgrade skills
- Progressive difficulty over time

---

Planned Features

- Multiple upgradable spell paths (fire, lightning, defense)
- Scaling enemy waves and minibosses
- Lightweight meta-progression
- Web-first deployment

---

Project Status

🟡 Early design / pre-implementation

The current focus is:

- Finalizing the MVP scope
- Locking the core gameplay loop
- Choosing the implementation approach (engine + tooling)

---

Tech Direction

To be determined. This project may use:

- A lightweight 2D engine (Godot / GameMaker / Construct)
- Or a code-first approach once the MVP is locked
